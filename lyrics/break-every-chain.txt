There is power in the name of Jesus [3x]
to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [2x]

There's an army rising up. [3x]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [2x]

[Chorus:]
There's an army rising up. [3x]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [2x]

I hear the chains falling.

There is power in the name of Jesus
to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
