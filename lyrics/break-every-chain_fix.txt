There is power in the name of Jesus [x3]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [x2]

[Chorus:]
There is power in the name of Jesus [x3]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [x2]

[Verse:]
There's an army rising up. [x3]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [x2]

[Chorus:]
There's an army rising up. [x3]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [x2]

[Bridge:]
I hear the chains falling.

[Chorus:]
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
