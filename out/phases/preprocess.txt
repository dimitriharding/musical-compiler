"BREAK EVERY CHAIN"

[Verse:]
There is power in the name of Jesus 
There is power in the name of Jesus 
There is power in the name of Jesus 

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 


[Chorus:]
There is power in the name of Jesus 
There is power in the name of Jesus 
There is power in the name of Jesus 

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 


[Verse:]
There's an army rising up. 
There's an army rising up. 
There's an army rising up. 

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 


[Chorus:]
There's an army rising up. 
There's an army rising up. 
There's an army rising up. 

To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 


[Bridge:]
I hear the chains falling.

[Chorus:]
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
